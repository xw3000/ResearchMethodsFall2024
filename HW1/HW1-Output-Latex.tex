    \textbf{Notes}: This table contains regressions predicting whether the fictitious candidate's job application was called back (1 or 0) as a function of whether subjects had an elite college education (1 or 0). Standard OLS standard errors are reported.

\end{table}

On average, candidates with elite college education appear to be 14 percentage points more likely to receive a callback from their job applications.
